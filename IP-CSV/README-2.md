#Readme

All of the work has been correctly implemented. 
I did not discuss the assignment with anyone, however I did read piazza extensively. 
I spend between 1 and 2 hours completing this lab.

I utilized Python3 in combination with the GeoIp2 countries library. This needs to be installed before the program can run.
To install the geoip2 module on Linux type the following into the command line:
$ pip3 install geoip2
Additionally, download the GeoIp2 countries database here:

Interestingly, the majority of the IP addresses were located in the United States and the Netherlands, with Russia and Germany far behind those.
This examplifies the attribution problem in security; the IP addresses came from all over the world, yet ultimately Russia is deemed the actor.

(With me being Dutch, this is the rare occasion where I can link... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELD2AwFN9Nc )
